# Pneumonia-Detection-using-CNN-
In this project, we addressed the imperative need for robust pneumonia detection using CNNs.  We employed a comprehensive dataset comprising 5856 chest X-ray images categorized into  two classes: normal and pneumonia. Four distinct models were trained and evaluated for their  performance: VGG16, VGG19, ResNet-50, and CondenseNet.
